# Project: eventregadmin - React

The Event Registration prototype using React needs an Admin interface, so I'm going to use React Admin. It will need to connect to my API in another repo/server.

## Next Steps
* Get data from other API (not the JSON file)
* Replace the "range.js" with getting the actual range of returned records

## Optimizations
*
